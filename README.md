  I am a senior student from Canyon View High School who's interests mainly lies in programming computers and music. I gained an interest in computers a few years ago when I watched someone on youtube create the code for a 2048 game.  
    
  I am taking this course because I enjoy coding computers. I believe that technology plays a big part in the advancement of society, and I would love to be one of the people who makes the world easier for everyone.
